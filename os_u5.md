# ðŸ§  **Operating System - Unit 5: I/O and File Management**

---

## ðŸ“˜ 1. **Organization of I/O Functions**

I/O (Input/Output) operations are essential for any computer system to interact with the outside world. The Operating System (OS) handles complex communication between user programs and physical hardware through a layered architecture.

### ðŸ”¹ Goals of I/O System:
- Efficient and secure data transmission between memory and devices.
- Standard interface for different devices.
- Coordination between multiple I/O devices.
  
### ðŸ”¹ Layers of I/O System:
1. **User-Level I/O:**
   - High-level programming functions used in user programs.
   - Examples: `scanf()`, `printf()`, `fread()`, `fwrite()` in C.
   - Easy for programmers but requires OS support.

2. **Device-Independent I/O:**
   - Provides uniform interfaces for devices regardless of hardware.
   - Responsibilities:
     - Naming devices (e.g., `/dev/usb0`)
     - Buffering, error handling, protection

3. **Device Drivers:**
   - Specific programs that understand hardware communication.
   - Translate high-level commands into device-specific commands.
   - Loaded during system boot or dynamically.

4. **Interrupt Handlers:**
   - Devices generate **interrupts** when they complete operations.
   - The OS has handlers to respond and resume suspended processes.

> **Example:** When you copy a file to a pen drive, OS invokes user-level copy command, uses buffering, communicates with the USB driver, and manages interrupts when the copy is done.

## ðŸ“˜ 2. **I/O Buffering**

I/O devices are often slower than the CPU, so buffering is used to match speeds and improve performance.

### ðŸ”¹ Buffer:
A **buffer** is a portion of memory set aside to store data temporarily while it is being moved from one place to another.

### ðŸ”¹ Types of Buffering:

1. **Single Buffering:**
   - Only one buffer is used.
   - CPU has to wait if data is not yet ready.

2. **Double Buffering:**
   - Two buffers are used in parallel.
   - While one buffer is being used, the other is being filled.
   - Improves efficiency, reduces CPU wait time.

3. **Circular Buffering:**
   - A ring of multiple buffers.
   - Data flows in a circular manner.
   - Commonly used in real-time and multimedia applications.

> **Example:** When you stream a YouTube video, it preloads upcoming data using circular buffering to avoid lags.

## ðŸ“˜ 3. **Disk Scheduling**

Multiple processes may request disk access at the same time. Disk scheduling algorithms determine the order in which these requests are served.

### ðŸ”¹ Why Scheduling is Needed:
- Disk heads have to **move (seek)** to the data location.
- Poor scheduling = more seek time = low performance.

### ðŸ”¹ Common Disk Scheduling Algorithms:

1. **FCFS (First Come First Serve):**
   - Processes requests in the order they arrive.
   - Simple but may lead to long delays.

2. **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First):**
   - Selects the request closest to current head position.
   - Reduces total seek time but may cause starvation.

3. **SCAN (Elevator Algorithm):**
   - Head moves in one direction, serves requests, then reverses.
   - Fair and better than FCFS.

4. **LOOK:**
   - Like SCAN but turns around at last request, not end of disk.

5. **C-SCAN (Circular SCAN):**
   - Head moves in one direction only, returns to beginning after reaching end.
   - Provides more uniform wait times.

6. **C-LOOK:**
   - Like C-SCAN but returns to first request, not beginning of disk.

> **Example:** In SSTF, if head is at track 30 and requests are at 25, 32, 50, 60 â€“ it will first go to 32 (nearest), not necessarily the first in queue.

## ðŸ“˜ 4. **RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)**

RAID is a data storage technique using multiple disks to improve **performance** and **fault tolerance**.

### ðŸ”¹ Benefits:
- Increased reliability
- Improved read/write speed
- Data redundancy

### ðŸ”¹ Common RAID Levels:

1. **RAID 0 â€“ Striping:**
   - Splits data across multiple disks.
   - No redundancy. If one fails, data is lost.
   - High speed.

2. **RAID 1 â€“ Mirroring:**
   - Duplicates data on two or more disks.
   - Provides fault tolerance.
   - Slower write speed, but safe.

3. **RAID 5 â€“ Striping with Parity:**
   - Data is striped across disks with parity bits.
   - If one disk fails, data can be recovered using parity.
   - Balanced performance and reliability.

> **Example:** RAID 1 is used in servers where data safety is crucial.

## ðŸ“˜ 5. **File Concept**

A **file** is a named collection of related information stored on secondary storage (like HDD, SSD, or USB).

### ðŸ”¹ File Attributes:
- **Name**: File identifier (e.g., notes.txt)
- **Type**: Executable, text, image, etc.
- **Location**: Directory path
- **Size**: In bytes
- **Time, Date**: Creation, last modified
- **Permissions**: Read, write, execute

### ðŸ”¹ File Operations:
- **Create** â€“ Create a new file.
- **Open** â€“ Load file into memory.
- **Read/Write** â€“ Transfer data to/from file.
- **Reposition** â€“ Move file pointer.
- **Close** â€“ Finish working on file.
- **Delete** â€“ Remove file from storage.

> **Example:** When you open a `.docx` file, OS reads its metadata (name, type, permissions) before loading it.

## ðŸ“˜ 6. **Access Methods**

Different ways to access or retrieve file data depending on the type of application.

### ðŸ”¹ Types:

1. **Sequential Access:**
   - Read data in order, one by one.
   - Cannot skip; slow for large files.
   - Used in log files, audio/video.

2. **Direct (Random) Access:**
   - Jump to any location in file using index.
   - Faster, flexible.
   - Used in databases.

3. **Indexed Access:**
   - Uses an index or map to locate data blocks.
   - Combines speed of direct access with flexibility of sequential access.

> **Example:** Playing an audio file from the middle requires direct access.

## ðŸ“˜ 7. **Directory Structures**

A directory is a container for files and other directories. It helps in organizing files efficiently.

### ðŸ”¹ Types of Directory Structures:

1. **Single-Level Directory:**
   - All files in one folder.
   - Simple, but causes name conflicts.

2. **Two-Level Directory:**
   - Separate directory for each user.
   - Solves name conflict but still limited.

3. **Tree-Structured Directory:**
   - Hierarchical structure (folders, subfolders).
   - Used in Windows/Linux systems.

4. **Acyclic Graph Directory:**
   - Allows sharing files among users.
   - Prevents cycles (no infinite loops).

5. **General Graph Directory:**
   - Similar to acyclic, but allows cycles.
   - Requires garbage collection and reference counting.

> **Example:** C:\Users\Abhishek\Documents\Project is part of a tree-structured directory.

## ðŸ“˜ 8. **Protection**

Protection ensures that only authorized users can access or modify files and system resources.

### ðŸ”¹ Types of Protection:

1. **Access Control:**
   - Each file has a list specifying who can read/write/execute.
   - Example: Admin can modify, others can read only.

2. **Password Protection:**
   - Some files are accessible only after entering a password.

3. **User Groups and Permissions:**
   - Group similar users and assign permissions.
   - Example: In Linux, `chmod`, `chown` commands.

### ðŸ”¹ Protection in OS:
- Prevents malware, data leakage, accidental deletion.
- Ensures multi-user environment is secure.

> **Example:** In college labs, students can only access their folders, not others'.
