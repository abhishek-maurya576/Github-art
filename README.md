**EduReach Android App: Complete Blueprint**
 
**I. Project Goals and Scope:**

*   **Goal:** Develop a functional Android app that provides personalized learning experiences to students, leverages AI for learning gap analysis, and demonstrates potential for social impact in underserved communities.
*   **Scope:**
    *   **Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** Focus on core features: user authentication, AI-driven assessment, personalized learning path display, basic content delivery (text/video), and progress tracking.
    *   **Target Audience:** Students in underserved communities with limited internet access.
    *   **Timeframe:** Within the hackathon timeframe (24-48 hours typically).

**II. Technical Architecture:**

*   **Layered Architecture:**
    *   **Presentation Layer (UI):** Android app (Kotlin/Java, XML layouts). Responsible for user interaction and displaying data.
    *   **Business Logic Layer:** Manages application logic, data processing, and API communication. Resides within the Android app and on the backend (server-side).
    *   **Data Access Layer:** Handles data storage and retrieval (Firestore or Firebase Realtime Database).
    *   **External API Layer:** Interacts with external APIs (Gemini, Vision, Translation).

**III. Technology Stack:**

*   **Frontend (Android App):**
    *   **Language:** Kotlin (recommended) or Java
    *   **IDE:** Android Studio
    *   **UI Framework:** Android SDK (XML layouts, Jetpack Compose *if time allows*)
    *   **Networking Library:** Retrofit (for API communication) or Volley
    *   **Image Loading Library:** Glide or Picasso
    *   **Architecture Pattern:** Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) or Model-View-Intent (MVI) – promotes testability and separation of concerns
*   **Backend:**
    *   **Language:** Python (recommended) or Node.js
    *   **Framework:** Flask (Python) or FastAPI (Python) or Express (Node.js)
    *   **Deployment:** Google Cloud Functions (serverless)
    *   **API Gateway:** (Implicit via Cloud Functions URLs)
*   **Database:**
    *   Firestore (NoSQL Cloud Database) – Recommended for scalability and easy integration with Firebase
*   **APIs:**
    *   **Gemini Pro API:**
        *   Text Input: Accepts student-written responses, essays, etc.
        *   Text Output: Generates personalized learning plans, content recommendations, assessment analysis.
    *   **Cloud Vision API:**
        *   OCR (Optical Character Recognition): Extracts text from images of documents or learning materials.
    *   **Cloud Translation API:**
        *   Translates text between languages.
    *   **Firebase (Optional, but Helpful):**
        *   Authentication: Manages user accounts and logins.
        *   Firestore: Simplified database access if not using a custom backend.
        *   Cloud Messaging (FCM): Push notifications.

**IV. Modules and Features (MVP Scope):**

1.  **Authentication Module:**
    *   **Features:** User registration (email/password, Google Sign-In via Firebase Authentication), login, logout.
    *   **UI:** Registration screen, login screen, profile screen.

2.  **AI-Driven Assessment Module:**
    *   **Features:** Adaptive assessment powered by Gemini. Questions adjust in difficulty based on student performance.

    *   **Backend:** Processes assessment responses using the Gemini API to determine skill levels and learning gaps.

3.  **Personalized Learning Path Module:**
    *   **Features:** Displays a personalized learning path based on the AI assessment results. Recommends learning resources (text, videos) and activities.
    *   **UI:** Learning path screen, resource list, activity previews.
    *   **Backend:** Generates the learning path using the Gemini API, curates relevant content.

4.  **Content Delivery Module:**
    *   **Features:** Displays learning content (text, embedded YouTube videos).
    *   **UI:** Text display screen, video player.
    *   **YouTube Integration:** Use the YouTube Android Player API to play videos seamlessly.

5.  **Progress Tracking Module:**
    *   **Features:** Tracks student progress through the learning path (e.g., activities completed, scores).
    *   **UI:** Progress bar, activity completion indicators.
    *   **Backend:** Stores progress data in Firestore.

**V. Data Model:**

*   **User:**
    *   `userId` (String, unique ID)
    *   `email` (String)
    *   `displayName` (String)
    *   `profilePictureUrl` (String)
*   **LearningPath:**
    *   `pathId` (String, unique ID)
    *   `userId` (String, reference to User)
    *   `title` (String, e.g., "Basic Algebra")
    *   `description` (String)
    *   `modules` (List of Module objects)
